### Who are you, in a few sentences?

I’m Raffael — a software engineer who grew up in Neu-Ulm and now lives by Lake Constance. I love traveling, exercising, listening to music, reading, and spending time in nature. I’m a bit of a nerd when it comes to investing and finance, and I enjoy socializing and learning new things about the world, people, and myself.

### How did you end up getting into software engineering?

I actually started out studying mechanical engineering and even worked in crash testing for a large automotive company during my bachelor’s degree. My fascination with programming began when I worked on a student project building a quadcopter, where I implemented basic PID control algorithms on an Arduino. From that point on, I directed my academic path more toward software engineering in the automotive field — both during my master’s degree and while working part-time as a student. That eventually led me to my first full-time job in software engineering.

### Do you remember the first thing you ever coded?

Yes! Before building my own quadcopter, I took a semester-long Java programming course. Inspired by the movie 21, I built a blackjack game that could count cards to improve its odds of winning (with a small deck size and no shuffle).

### Favorite song or band?

I enjoy a wide range of music styles and tend to binge one genre until I find something new that inspires me. I’m usually into punk rock and metal, but sometimes a catchy pop song from the radio grabs my attention too.

### Favorite books?

I’m interested in books on human history, psychology, finance, geopolitics, health and longevity, and spirituality. Some of my favorite authors are Yuval Noah Harari, Robert Greene, Jordan Peterson, Morgan Housel, André Kostolany, Tim Marshall, Peter Attia, and Eckhart Tolle.

### What does a good weekend look like for you?

I enjoy busy weekends visiting friends or family, or taking city trips. But to fully recharge, I also need some quieter weekends with no plans — doing some exercise, having brunch, reading a book, or listening to new podcasts. Cooking new recipes is something I really enjoy too, especially since I rely on company catering during the week.

### What’s your current routine or ritual that keeps you sane?

I’m currently on a mindfulness journey after reading Eckhart Tolle. I try to meditate in the evenings after a short stretching session. Still, I think the gym remains the best way for me to stay balanced and clear my head.

### What’s a recent hobby you’ve picked up?

I started running and training for a marathon. Running became my new passion after I stopped playing football due to too many injuries, which I was playing since early childhood.

### Coffee order?

Black coffee — no sugar.

### If your playlist had a “developer mode,” what would be on it?

When I need to focus, I usually listen to slow techno or classical music. Both help me get into a good flow state.

### What’s a simple thing that always makes your day better?

Even if it is a really busy day and I have no time to calm down I enjoy to walk 10 - 20 minutes through the Ried in Eriskirch. It is really close to my home. No headphones, no cellphone.

### Do you prefer mornings or nights for deep work or thinking time?

Definitely late afternoons. That way, I still have enough time afterward to exercise and wind down before bed. I’m definitely more of a “later-in-the-day” person from a chronotype perspective.

What’s something you’re excited about learning or building next?

Right now, I’m learning Portuguese with Duolingo — it’s the mother tongue of my girlfriend, so it’s both fun and meaningful to learn.
