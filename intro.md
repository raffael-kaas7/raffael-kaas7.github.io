Hi, I am Raffael, a software engineering living at Lake Constance (Friedrichshafen), working in the automotive industry. I hold a Master of Engineering with a focus on autonomous systems. 
During the last couple of years, I worked for very different kind of software project from building my own quadrocopter as a student, to pushing autonomous shuttles into operation in Rotterdam, to base software series development for converter applications today. 

I like working on Linux, using C/C++ for embedded software and python to make live easier.  

Beside work, I am curious about finance and investment. Furthermore playing football, running, lifting weights, or exploring new trails on my gravel bike. I love discovering fresh perspectives, whether that's through travel, meaningful conversations, or diving into a good book. Always curious, always learning.



Hi, I'm Raffael – a software engineer based at Lake Constance, working in the automotive industry. I hold a Master of Engineering with a focus on autonomous systems. Over the past few years, I've worked on a wide range of complex software projects – from building my own quadcopter during university time, to launching autonomous shuttles in Rotterdam, and now developing series production software for power converters in e-mobility.

I like working on a Linux based system, using C/C++ for embedded software and Python to make live easier. I enjoy using ROS for fast development and have experience working with RTOS (Autosar classic)

Outside of engineering, I explore other passions: running, lifting, and finance. I 'm curious by nature, and always open to fresh ideas through books, travel, or conversation.
