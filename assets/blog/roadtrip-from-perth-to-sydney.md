I’ve traveled quite a bit over the last couple of years — Thailand, Morocco, the United States, Peru. Great experiences, but if I’m honest: I didn’t document them properly. Not in a way that makes you feel the trip again months later. Photos are usually scattered across devices and clouds, mixed with thousands of screenshots, memes, and random food shots. And even if you do have the pictures — how often do you actually open and recap them in your spare time?

At some point I started making photo books after bigger trips. For sure, it's a lot of work, but it’s the kind of work you will definitely appreciate, when you sit on a couch later and flip through real pages remembering details of the trip you would have forgotten otherwise. It's also nice when having guests around showing them your traveling experiences in a photo book istead of swiping through your smartphone.

Since I've created this website a few months ago, I wanted to write down the trip in a way that’s readable and useful — for future me, and for anyone thinking about doing a road trip in Australia.

In December, we drove from Perth to Sydney in a Motorhome. Western Australia, the Nullarbor, Southern Australia, Victoria and New South Wales — beaches that look like paintings, exciting wild life, weather in all seasons, lots of BBQ stations, big cities and very, very friendly people. Here is the full recap:

## Ho Chi Minh City layover (30.11)

The trip started in Munich, then a long flight to Vietnam (~11 hours), and after that another flight to Perth (~9 hours). We had a layover of roughly 9 hours in Ho Chi Minh City — long enough to actually leave the airport and get a quick impression of the city and some real food. 

We took a Grab (basically Uber) into District 1, walked through busy streets, crowded markets, and ended up eating somewhere without really knowing what we ordered. To me, it felt like Bangkok in terms of energy and sweaty 30 degrees, but this time with Christmas decorations all over the city. Time went fast and the layover was used really great.

<div class="section-break"></div>

## Perth (01.12 – 02.12)

We landed in Perth late at night, around 22:00 and took an Uber to the Criterion Hotel, where we stayed the until 4th of december. Quick check-in and straight into bed, after this long trip to Australia.

The next morning we went for a run in Harrison Park, a recommendation of a friend of mine to directly get the first Australia-Moment seeing kangaroos. You will see them beyond trees in some show places. 

Perth itself felt clean, relaxed, and surprisingly modern. We did city sightseeing, visited the Perth City Library and later did the Perth Mint tour. Probably not intersting for everyone but I am collecting some silver coin series produced there since a few years and actually ended up buing the new Lunar II coin of 2026 (Year of the Horse).

In the evening we walked along the Swan River and went up to Kings Park. Sunset from the State War Memorial viewpoint with the skyline in front is definitely a Perth highlight.

Dinner was at a small Asian place: cheap, simple, extremely good. That also became a theme: Australia can be expensive in many ways, but you can still eat well without going crazy.

## Rottnest Island (03.12)

Rottnest Island was our first proper day trip. We took the ferry, rented bikes, and basically did the classic “cycle around the island and stop at beaches”-tour. Ricey Beach was our favorite: quiet, clear water, and far less crowded than the main spots. We also saw quokkas, which was both cute and slightly sad depending on where. In nature places, they’re just doing their thing. In the touristic parts of the island, they’re clearly used to humans and out of the inteded wildlife life.

Back in Perth we went for Korean BBQ — one of those meals where you don’t talk much because you’re busy cooking by your own and eating in parallel. In contrast to the suburb parts, all the big cities in Australia are multi culti and you find the best restaurant for whatever you like to.

## Camper pickup & first free camp near Pinjarra (04.12)

<div class="section-break"></div>

We did a morning run in Kings Park so some other parts of it than on the sunset-evening, then check-out and took the bus to pick up the camper. It's like you know from stories. Hell the driver to make him stop and even in the big cities, everyone exists with a "thank you" to the bus driver.

First impression of our motorhome: this thing felt like a small ship. We were happy, but also slightly intimidated. I got really quick used to driving on the left side and driving clockwise into roundabouts, but until the end of the trip I got not used to the big wheelbase. Parking backwards, I always ened up two parking slots beside the one I intended to.

We stopped at Aldi, stocked up the fridge, and drove south. Busselton was too far for a relaxed first van day, so we ended up free camping near Pinjarra. It felt good to fall asleep in the van for the first time, but the free spot was directly beside a train crossing. You can't image how slow trains are driving in australia and they use a horn to make aware of themself. Once per hour, the full night.

<div class="section-break"></div>

<div class="section-break"></div>

## Busselton → Dunsborough (05.12)

We drove to Busselton and walked the jetty (1.8 km - yes!). Long, straight, simple. If you want, you can even hop on a small train to get out.

After that we continued towards Dunsborough and stayed at our first proper campsite (Southern Stars Holiday Park). That day was also the day we properly learned the camper basics. An Aussie helped us with power, water, waste, and toilet emptying. I really had a hard time to follow him and his aussie slang.

We used a BBQ station and made chicken with rice. Across Australia you will see a lot of BBQ Stations. They are powered by gas and you just need to push a button, to get your 15 min heat. They are arcross the whole country, on caravan parks, but also on public places likes beaches or playgrounds. The Aussies are really friendly people, so you will always end up in a nice, casual coversation with the guys using the BBQ station next to you.

## Dunsborough & Castle Rock Bay (06.12)

In the morning, whenever possible we did a small workout. Whether it is running or exercises, depends on the circumstances. Whenever there is a playground nearby I choose for calisthenics. After that we cooked our “standard breakfast” in the camper. Eggs, toast, avocado, sometimes bacon, muesli, yogurt, instant coffee.

In Dunsborough we parked our car nearby the start of an trail and walked to Castle Rock Bay. The trail was beautiful and the beach was unreal. The only nasty thing were the 1000 flies around you walking, but I guess this is what comes with beatiful, multi culture nature. Especially in Western and Southern Austalia, we had so many flies that it sometimes was not possible / managable to have breakfast outside with camping table and seats. I am not sure if this is a regional or seasonal phanomoen. Whenever you are around december in western australia in the suburban parts, you will have nasty flies all time around you. 

In the afternoon we headed towards Margaret River, but we had problems finding a campsite. Many places were fully booked and wild camping was not allowed in this area. We ended up on an overflow option in the Margaret River Tourist Park. Until now, I’m not 100% sure what exactly makes Margaret River so special compared to other parts of western australia — we were basically just passing through and probably missed the core experience.

## Augusta → Denmark (07.12)

We drove to Augusta and checked out the lighthouse (Cape Leeuwin) and the cape where the Indian Ocean meets the Southern Ocean. In my opinition it is worth to visit even though it might be 1 hour more in the car on the trip. 

Albany was originally planned for that day, but we stopped at a vineyard on the way, did a small tasting, and the owner recommended Denmark instead. We got gifted some incredible organic avocados and bought a bottle of wine.

The drive to Denmark was one of the prettiest roads: forest, red soil as well as deep green and brown tones.

We stayed at BIG4 Denmark Ocean Beach Holiday Park and had intense kangaroo contact. Starting with the dusk, the kangaross occupied the free camp sites on the caravan park in big groups.

## Valley of the Giants, Elephant Cove & Greens Pool (08.12)

We started slow, no stress, and drove to the Valley of the Giants for the tree top walk. The red tingle trees reminded me of Sequoia parks in the US, just with their own Australian personality.

After that we went to Elephant Cove and Greens Pool. Both are absurdly beautiful. The only “problem” was the weather: cold, cloudy, and windy. That’s something people underestimate. The south-west and south of Australia can be surprisingly cold even in summer. We had days with 17°C and nights dropping to 9°C. Couple of days later you can have sunny days with 30°C upwards.

## Albany & Torndirrup National Park (09.12)

In Albany we did a stopped at Bunnings and pushed our camper furniture to the next level with some custom fairy lights and christmas decoration. Bunning is comparable to Home Depot, OBI or Baumarkt. On that day we went out for breakfast. In general I loved to order poached eggs, since I am not really good in doing them on my own. I can recommend to go with the Eggs Benedict where you normally get two of them along with toast, spinach and sauce Hollondaise!. My girlfriend started ordering mocha everywhere from this point on — hot or iced — while I kept odering a long black (Americano). The australians do great coffe. In other travels, this often was something I missed from home, but not in Australia. 

Around Albany itself, we did the Bald Head hike in Torndirrup National Park. Coastal trail, strong wind, insane views — probably the number one hike of our total trip. We cooled down at Misery Beach afterwards, which is extremely beautiful but had surprisingly expensive parking. I think it included entry fee to the national park itself. Still worth it. Normally you don't pay for parking in Australia (except big cities car park which we never used with the 3m+ height motorhome).

Our first choice campsite was unfortunately booked out, so we stayed at Happy Days Caravan Park (cash, unpowered). Cheap, simple, end perfect for a one night overlay.

## Bremer Bay (10.12)

On that day we drove to Bremer Bay, checked in, had breakfast, and somehow felt knocked out. After a nap we walked to the beach on a trail but returned quickly because it was cold and windy. The rest of the day was slow and relaxed. We haven't done much in this area, but I think you can definitely spend some more time there. The region is known for whale exepitions since there is a big canion in the ocean out there.

<div class="section-break"></div>

## Esperance & Cape Le Grand National Park (11.12)

We drove from Bremer Bay to Esperance — around four hours — and went straight into Cape Le Grand National Park because this day the weather was perfect and we wanted to use every minute. Thistle Cove, Hellfire Bay… I don’t even know how to describe it properly. The sand is bright, the water has that painted turquoise, and it feels unreal how clean and open everything is. Definitely the most beatiful, lonely, beaches I've ever seen. In that park there is also lucky beach which is known for having wild kangoruus on the beach sometimes. Since we enjoyed both the other beaches too long we missed to drive to lucky beach. 

We stayed at an EcoCamp campsite in the middle of eucalyptus trees. In the evening at the camp citchen, we met Germans (an older couple traveling a full year with car and tent) and also a young Argentinian work-and-travel group. Nice catch up.

## Esperance → Norseman (12.12)

Since we spent the day before completely in the National Park, we briefly visited Esperance in the morning for a coffee at Coffee Cat at the foreshore, and did grocery shopping. From that point on, Woolworths became our main supermarket. Aldi might be cheaper sometimes, but Woolworths felt like the best overall experience, especially for fresh seafood and meat.

We cooked almost every evening, often meat, seafood, fish. It was sometimes cheaper than in Germany, especially with a good exchange rate at that  / year of our visit — and the quality of seafood felt insanely good.

In the evening we reached Norseman. It felt like a small town with strong “ghost town” energy — not fully dead, but… quiet. Norseman is basically the start point for the Nullarbor crossing, and the next days were going to be a different kind of Australia.

We stayed at a free camping spot, did a small walk to a viewpoint, passed a gold mine on the way (Pantoro, according to the sign around 100,000 oz per year), and had dinner: the first time “Ceviche à la Raffael” with seafood, koriander and lime.

<div class="section-break"></div>

## Nullarbor: cliffs free camp near the WA/SA border (13.12)

Nullarbor day one: full tank, coffee from a service station, and then you set the navigation to a campsite and it tells you something like: “in 750 km, turn right”. That’s not a joke. That’s literally the kind of road you’re driving.

We took photos at the “90 Mile” and the “Australia’s longest straight road” sign. The straight stretch is around 145 km. It is not just a road without crossings, you literally do not have to move the steering wheel. It is just straight. 

In gerneral, the nulllabor is a very special kind of driving: road trains, other campervans, and every 1–2 hours a roadhouse with food and fuel. We tried meat pies, obviously. Driving is kind of boring, but for the 2 days outback experience I would do it again.

Somewhere during the day you cross the border from Western Australia to South Australia. We didn’t end up at our planned free camp spot — we found an even better one earlier on the cliffs, around 50 km before our original target. Cold, windy, but the ocean below and the feeling of being far away from everything was worth it.

## Ceduna (14.12)

After another ~400 km we arrived in Ceduna. Before that, there’s a quarantine checkpoint when crossing from WA to SA, where they inspect the vehicle to make sure you’re not carrying fruits and similar stuff across.

Ceduna itself wasn’t super exciting, but it was useful. We stayed at Ceduna Tourist Park, which was a perfect “maintenance stop”: refill water, laundry, proper shower, shaving, and a good camp kitchen.

We had a nice chat with older Aussie ladies while hanging up laundry. These little social moments happen constantly on trips like this. People are curious, friendly, and it never feels forced.

That evening we tried kangaroo meat for the first (and last) time. It was okay, but the taste didn’t really catched me.

## Streaky Bay → Point Labatt → Talia Caves → Farm Beach (15.12)

We stopped at Sceale Bay for a short cool-down, then drove towards Point Labatt Sea Lion Colony. Getting there was our first real “not properly paved road” experience.  Ridges, vibrations, slow driving. You can go faster, at around 60 km/h and it becomes smooth, but it still feels like your entire van is shaking itself apart. And if you need to brake, it gets chaotic quickly, so I drove very slow most of the time.

At Point Labatt we watched sea lions from a distance. It’s a common place for their breeding, and you feel like you’re observing a quiet natural routine.

Talia Caves was next, also not super easy to reach, but it was worth it. You can really feel the violence of the ocean there. The energy, the wind, the noise — it’s raw, almost intimidating.

Later we drove to Farm Beach. The landscapes changed: more agriculture, more yellow tones, bright sky, less of the deep green-red contrast we had before. We saw huge John Deere machines, silos, and tractors literally pulling boats into the water on the beach.

The campsite "Farm Beach" required online booking for ~20 AUD — also a good lesson: even simple places are increasingly digitized. Booking when you already in the national park may take a while, since the network connection can be really bad. You pay online and just register your licence plate. I've never seen one, but according to some Aussies "the ranger" checks the camp site every night.

## Farm Beach morning → Port Lincoln (16.12)

Farm Beach in the morning was calm and beautiful. No waves, quiet water, and while I was swimming I saw a dolphin and some very cool starfish. We had breakfast with the usual chaos of flies, then drove to Port Lincoln.

Energy was low, so we focused on recovery: good campsite, good facilities, little city walk, coffee at the foreshore. In the evening: seafood grilled in the camp kitchen.

## Red Banks Beach → Clinton free camp (17.12)

We wanted to go towards Adelaide next, but it was too far for a relaxed day. So we planned a free camping stop around two hours before Adelaide.

On the way we stopped at Red Banks Beach. It was very hot that day and a short heat wave was coming, with temperatures up to 40°C. That kind of weather shift is insane when you remember we had 9°C nights not long before.

We stayed at a free camp directly near the beach and made burgers in the van kitchen while looking at the ocean. The small town vibe in Clinton was very friendly. Go for random places in Australia that you don't read in any traveling blog! There a lot of beatiful, inviting small towns.

## Adelaide (18.12 – 19.12)

We left very early for Adelaide and didn’t even do breakfast because we wanted to secure a campsite. Holiday season had started and many places were booked out. Eventually we got lucky at Brownhill Creek Caravan Park — very green, good facilities, and a bus connection into the city.

After arriving we finally had breakfast and then went into Adelaide. It was extremely hot. We visited Victoria Square, the market, and the botanical garden. In the evening we ended up at a local bar near Rundle Mall where people were watching cricket. Australia vs. England in Adelaide — and you really feel how much cricket matters here.

The next day we returned to the Victoria Market because it was definitely the best food markets we saw in Ausrailia It’s the perfect place to start a day with a big breakfast and then snack your way through random stalls. We also visited the State Library of South Australia, which is very impressive, and a museum where we learned more about art and Indigenous history.

## Coorong National Park (20.12)

We left Adelaide and before starting the Great Ocean Road we did a stop at Coorong National Park and stayed at 42 Miles Campground. On the way we saw one of the many pink lakes. Not a famous one, but it actually had water in it and you could see the color from the high salt content. The National Park itself felt like “maximum nature”: very few people, strong wind, and with beautiful trail to the ocean from our campsite. Swimming wasn’t really an option — the coast felt too wild and cold. On the way back we saw Emus, which we haven't seen so close before while walking and not being in the car.

## Mount Gambier (21.12)

This was our first real rainy day. We drove to Mount Gambier, didn’t do much, and spent time in the camper. We were happy to have a powered campsite, because we could use the air condition for heating. It still sounds ridiculous tom me in “Australian summer”, but it was really cold.

In the evening, while grilling, we met a very nice family from Sydney traveling with two campervans and their sons. We talked for a long time. Again, these spontaneous campground conversations are honestly one of the best parts of camper travel.

## Mount Bambier -> Portland → Port Campbell (22.12)

After breakfast we quickly checked out Blue Lake and then drove towards Portland. This was a recommendation from an Aussie I had met in Adelaide: “If you drive the Great Ocean Road, you can start earlier, in Portland, not Warrnambool like usually recommended.”

Portland gave us cliff vibes, lighthouses, and wind turbines — very impressive landscape.

We continued to Port Campbell and along the way, we stopped in Port Fairy for coffee at Rebecca’s Coffee. The town felt cool: small, surfer vibe, people casually hanging out. 


This night we stayed at an NRMA Holiday Park. One of the few campsites we have booked in advance. I feared that the whole great ocean road would be completely overcrowed in the holiday season. It actually was quite calm, expect the for the tourist bus chaos at the 12 Apostels Viewpoint.


After check-in we visited The Grotto and London Bridge. London Bridge in the evening light with strong wind was one of my favorite moments on the Great Ocean Road. Everything just fit together: colors, wind, atmosphere.

## Great Ocean Road → Apollo Bay (23.12)

We started around 9:00 and planned to arrive in Apollo Bay (Apollo Bay Recreation Reserve) late afternoon. On this road you can basically stop every few kilometers for a viewpoint (the brown signs along the road), and honestly: the 12 Apostles are impressive, but they’re not the only impressive spot. Many other viewpoints (Bakers Oven, Razorback, Island Arch Lookout, just to name a few) felt equally stunning with far fewer people.

The morning weather was bad and we even did a small nap in the car. Later the sun came and stayed for the rest of the day.

We also visited the Great Ocean Road Wildlife Park (recommended by a friend). It’s small and lovingly run. We saw Emus and one Koala properly up close. Actually, we've seen some wild Koalas later that day. The only time on the whole trip.

## Torquay free camp “Christmas episode” (24.12)

This day started with rain and a road closure that cost us about 1.5 hours detour. We walked a famous koala path but didn’t see any. Instead we finally saw a kookaburra — until then we only heard them.

In the late afternoon we arrived in Torquay and couldn’t find a campsite anymore. We decided to free camp spontaneously. Christmas dinner happened at a Chinese restaurant because basically everything else was closed.

Later we arrived late at our free camping spot near Melbourne. To create at least a bit of Christmas mood, we used the camper TV exactly once: we streamed Home Alone. That was also the day we accidentally booked the wrong campsite in Ballarat and couldn’t cancel it. Classic: the one time you’re tired and stressed, you pay the “human error tax”.

<div class="section-break"></div>

## Melbourne (25.12 – 26.12)

On the 25th we checked into Dandenong Tourist Park. We did a small jog, but it was so windy it wasn’t even fun. Melbourne weather is special. We didn’t go into the city because everything was closed anyway, so we did laundry and started cooking early.

Christmas dinner was surprisingly nice: lamb cutlets with lemon/honey, rice and salad. As a starter we did crackers with brie and fig jam, plus salami and avocado. Simple, but it felt cozy in that campsite kitchen.

On the 26th we went into Melbourne city. Public transport was slightly annoying because Melbourne uses the Myki card instead of simple tap-on/tap-off with credit cards like other cities. The weather was cold, windy, around 15°C. Later it got sunny but still not warm. It’s hard to believe that this region can have 45°C heat waves and fires a couple of weeks later. You can basically experience four seasons in one week.

Boxing Day meant discounts everywhere. Some sights like the State Library of Victoria were closed, but we visited an art gallery and later went to the cricket stadium area where there was a Boxing Day event vibe: food trucks, music, a small festival feeling. We finished the day at St Kilda Beach for a beer in the sun. People say there are penguins there in the evening, but we were there late afternoon and didn’t see any.

Back at the campsite: another good meal in the shared kitchen. This trip was basically: drive, walk, cook, repeat.

## Long drive day towards Sydney (27.12)

At this point we needed to move. Sydney was coming and time was running. We planned a full driving day and stayed at a free camping spot about 1–2 hours before Sydney.

No power meant no heating, and the night was brutally cold. We had unusually low temperatures for Australian summer — down to 9°C at night, and often only 17°C during the day with strong cold wind. It felt like Australia was trolling us.

<div class="section-break"></div>

## Sydney outskirts & Blue Mountains (28.12)

We checked into Ingenia Holidays Avina near Sydney because we wanted to have a smooth last camper day. The next day we had to return the van at 12:30, so this was the “buffer day”: cleaning, packing, and still doing something fun.

After check-in and breakfast we drove to the Blue Mountains. We did a small hike, visited the Three Sisters, and got coffee before heading back. In the evening we grilled seafood: green prawns, squid, and barramundi. This kind of dinner after a hike is peak roadtrip life.

## Camper return (29.12)

We woke up at 6:30, had breakfast, then the mission started: dismantle the bed (we kept it built most of the time), empty grey water, empty toilet, refuel, and do a full car wash inside and outside.

The handover went perfectly. We had tiny stone chips on the windshield, but after 6,700 km Perth to Sydney that’s basically expected. We got the full deposit back.

We went by public transport to our hotel: Lakeside Hotel & Conference Centre, a bit outside, but green, nice, and affordable around New Year’s. Public transport in Australia is generally very easy and cheap — tap-on/tap-off with your credit card — except Melbourne.

That day we didn’t go into the city. It was enough. We just went to Macquarie Centre nearby.

## Sydney: Manly, Opera House & first “wow” moment (30.12)

The hotel had a gym, which felt like luxury. After a month of improvised workouts (push-ups and pull-ups on playgrounds whenever possible), a real gym felt like returning to civilization.

Then we went into Sydney early for breakfast, crossing the Harbour Bridge by bus. That first view is insane. Sydney has that “this is a postcard” effect, but it still hits you.

We took the ferry to Manly Beach. Even the ferry ride is a highlight. The streets, the vibe, the beach — very recommendable. And seeing crowds again felt like an interesting contrast after so many empty Western Australia beaches.

We didn’t have much time in Manly because we booked a free walking tour at 15:00. In the evening we had fish & chips, saw the Opera House and Harbour Bridge up close, and ate what might have been the best ice cream of my life. Pistachio with real pistachios. In Australia one scoop is enough — they don’t do European “tiny ball” portions.

<div class="section-break"></div>

## Sydney: New Year’s Eve (31.12)

We slept a bit longer because we knew the night would be long. We dressed up and had breakfast in the Queen Victoria Building (QVB), then visited the State Library of New South Wales.

Later we went towards our planned vantage point for the fireworks: Campbells Cove. The strange part is the waiting. You basically commit your whole evening from around 16:30 until midnight just to secure a good view of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. Inside the secured area there’s no alcohol allowed (and none sold), but there are food trucks. You can prepare with snacks and drinks before entering.

It’s a weird but unique experience. You’re only once in Sydney on New Year’s Eve, and at midnight the whole city turns into a light show. Worth it — even if the waiting is borderline absurd.

## Train to Brisbane (01.01) & Gold Coast arrival (02.01)

We had a free New Year’s breakfast at the hotel, checked out, and went to Central Station with the metro. We bought snacks at Woolworths and boarded the overnight train to Brisbane around 15:00. From there, early in the morning, we continued to the Gold Coast.

When we arrived in Southport it was raining. With heavy luggage we escaped into a café at 7:00 in the morning, ate breakfast, and luckily could check into our accommodation shortly after. We stayed there until January 26 before flying back via Sydney to Munich.

<div class="section-break"></div>

## Reflections & practical notes (the stuff you only learn on the road)

Australia is incredibly safe. We felt safe free camping, safe in cities at night, and safe in rural areas. That’s not something I take for granted when I compare it to other countries I traveled to.

Western Australia and the Nullarbor have brutal stretches with bad internet coverage, and inside national parks you often have nothing. If you want a smoother experience, having a local SIM with an actual phone number can make sense. We had an eSIM without a number, which was okay for data, but not ideal for calling places when reception is weak.

Fuel prices during our trip were mostly between 160 and 190 cents per liter. In the outback it can get higher, but that range was typical for us. Our camper used about 10 liters / 100 km over the full distance. In total we drove roughly 6,700 km.

Flies deserve their own paragraph. In Western Australia, the Nullarbor, and parts of South Australia, they were sometimes unbearable. Eating outside can become a speedrun. Sometimes you just accept defeat and eat inside the van.

Camping is flexible, but not infinite. You can often drive to campsites and ask for spots, but in some regions and during holiday season it would have saved us time to book in advance. Margaret River was the classic “everything booked” situation.

The spectrum of camping options is huge. We had everything from free camps (basic, sometimes tolerated), to national park campgrounds with minimal facilities, to fully equipped holiday parks. Big4 and NRMA were consistently good choices. Prices ranged from 0 AUD (free spots) up to 60 AUD for good parks, often around 30–60 AUD depending on power and location.

Food felt slightly more expensive than Germany in general, but meat, fish, and seafood were often cheaper and higher quality — and we heavily used that advantage. BBQ stations everywhere made cooking fun and social. You often end up chatting with Aussies while turning steaks and swapping travel tips.

Regarding “dangerous animals”: you hear stories, but we didn’t see a single snake, despite hiking a lot in various conditions. In Queensland you see more big spiders outside, but it never felt like a real threat. And while you hear shark stories around surfing areas, I never encountered one. The safety infrastructure at popular beaches seems very mature.

Also interesting: rural Australia feels “typically Aussie”, while the big cities are extremely multicultural, especially with strong Asian influence. That contrast is part of what makes the trip feel so diverse.

<div class="section-break"></div>

## Closing thoughts

This road trip was a reminder of why I love traveling like this. The camper forces you into a simple rhythm: drive, explore, cook, sleep. Repeat. It’s not luxury, but it’s freedom.

And writing this down already feels worth it — because I can feel how quickly details fade if you don’t capture them. The beaches, the wind, the weird cold summer nights, the laundries in caravan parks, the roadhouses, the conversations. It all becomes one big blur unless you store it somewhere outside your brain.

If you’re thinking about doing a road trip in Australia: do it. But bring patience for weather surprises, book some campsites early in peak season, and accept that flies are part of the ecosystem.

And yes — I would do Perth to Sydney again.
Maybe with slightly better planning.
And maybe with a flamethrower for flies (just kidding).

If you want, in the next step we can:

add a short route overview section (with a simple “timeline + map placeholder”)

add consistent photo blocks per destination (so it’s easy for you to fill in images later)

or tighten the ending into a more “blog-like conclusion” similar to your other posts (more reflective, a bit more “lessons learned”).
