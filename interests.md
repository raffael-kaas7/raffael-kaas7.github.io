### 💻 Technologies
I love exploring new frameworks, tools, and languages. Coding is both a creative outlet and a problem-solving journey.

### 🌍 Environment
Sustainability and environmental awareness are important to me. I try to live and act with minimal impact.

### 🎭 Culture
Art, music, literature, and travel feed my curiosity and broaden my perspective.

### 🧘 Private
When I'm offline, I enjoy hiking, journaling, meditation, and quality time with friends & family.
